# File handling is an import part of programming which allows us to create, read, update and delete files. 

# Syntax
# open('filename', mode) # mode(r, a, w, x, t,b)  could be to read, write, update

#"r" - Read - Default value. Opens a file for reading, it returns an error if the file does not exist
#"a" - Append - Opens a file for appending, creates the file if it does not exist
#"w" - Write - Opens a file for writing, creates the file if it does not exist
#"x" - Create - Creates the specified file, returns an error if the file exists
#"t" - Text - Default value. Text mode
#"b" - Binary - Binary mode (e.g. images)

f = open('./files/reading_file_example.txt')
print(f) # <_io.TextIOWrapper name='./files/reading_file_example.txt' mode='r' encoding='UTF-8'>

with open('./files/writing_file_example.txt','w') as f:
