# The package folder contains a special file called init.py - it stores the package's content. If we put init.py in the package folder, python start recognizes it as a package. The init.py exposes specified resources from its modules to be imported to other python files. An empty init.py file makes all functions available when a package is imported. The init.py is essential for the folder to be recognized by Python as a package.
